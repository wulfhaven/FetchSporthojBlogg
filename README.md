FetchSporthojBlogg
==================
Small gadget program to scrape blogs down from http://sporthoj.com.
Written for my GF, that moved from that platform to another.

Use by feeding it the url of one of the blogs as an argument, like so:

download_blog.py http://www.sporthoj.com/blogg/?ulvhamne

This will find ALL the blogs for the user and download all the posts with images to files locally.
